A project that tries to grow ecosystems of plants and animals in people's browsers

This is a hobby project of mine which I have been kicking around for quite some time.
Its on the nth iteration of the idea, and perhaps this time I have gotten enough of the concept to go ahead and play around with it some.

The basic idea is to have bits of code assemble into virtual animals and plants, form  ecosystems and solve problems while each thing
is living its life. Its a very ineffient way of being massively parellel, and introduces some new (to me) programming concepts.

What had stumped me for so long was how to scale the code from the very tiny "molecule" to the very large animals made up of many cells.
The rules had to be simple,with fundamental ideas being the same from small to large ; and the rules had to allow evolution , competition and, of course, ecosystems to form naturally. Also, there had to be a way to communicate with the life forms.

Previous versions of this project had the rules to be too rigid, fussy and detailed. Maybe this time I got it right...

The first commits are simple html and javascript pages to let me expand this idea. Once I have the fundamentals down tight, I will make the pages talking about the concepts, and make better web pages to play around in. Once I have that up, I will transfer the whole thing to c++ compliled into js to run in the browser page, and allow hookups between people on different computers.
